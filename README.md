This document is intended to be used as a template for PhD theses. While
unofficial, it complies with the criteria set by the University of Luxembourg. It
is based on the theses of many fine folks who obtained their PhD at the SerVal
and TruX teams at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust,
University of Luxembourg. The template can be downloaded at:
